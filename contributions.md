# Contributions

Places to focus contributions and why. 

## Tweak Injection

### Substitute

https://github.com/kDVt/substitute

Goal: Implement new package support natively

### Substrate and libhooker

Code will be presented that can be pasted into each respective codebase.

The coding conventions of both should be respected.

## Procursus Bootstrap

https://github.com/kDVt/Procursus

This is the only bootstrap that will be contributed to, as it's the only repo that warrants any massive changes.

Procursus uses an entirely custom build system. A full, hopefully automated, addition of the new standard needs planned and discussed.
